#Bubble Sort

check the left-most elemnet(a) to the adjancent element(b)
if a > b => flip(a,b)
else do nothing
now move one element to right and repeat until we reach the end
time complexity => O(n)

#Merge Sort

Cut the array in half recursively until you have 2 nodes
check both the nodes and flip if necessary
then merge the groups  
time complexity => O(n)
